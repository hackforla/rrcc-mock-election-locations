# rrcc-mock-election-locations
The LA County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk's office has been working on a project that transforms the way we do voting in LA County.  It's called [Voting Solutions for All People (VSAP)](https://vsap.lavote.net/).  In next year's 2020 elections, they are rolling out new ballot counter equipment and a new process for voting.  Instead of a single day where people must go to an assigned polling location near their home, they will be able to vote at any voting center location over an 11-day period.

On September 28-29, they will be hosting [Mock Elections](https://lavote.net/home/voting-elections/current-elections/mock-election) held at 50 locations across the County to test the new voting system.  The full list of participating locations is listed on the website as a [PDF file](https://lavote.net/docs/rrcc/media/mock-election-flyerfinal.pdf) with each location's name and address.

A much more useful way to view this information is to put that data on a map so people can visually see the locations and decide which one they can visit.  This mini project, initiated at our 9/11/19 South LA Civic Hack Night, takes the address data, geocodes it, and visualizes it on a webmap hosted through this repository's GitHub Page.

This repository's source code was based off of [matikin9's Arts Datathon workshop website](https://github.com/matikin9/arts-datathon-3-crafting).
